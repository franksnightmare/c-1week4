can't find what PBV stands for

removed stringsswap as a member function of the strings class

a35:
fixed
moved private above public in the class interfaces
changed the tabs in the makefile to 4 tabs, in report the tabs were too short. be careful with that in final report.
included the implementations of constructor/destructor which was missing

a36:
fixed
elaborated more on the parts which were noted in the report
I am not sure if I explained correctly how the functionality class can access the data class (between dashed lines in a36)
please check that if you want
use the same folder (a36) for the report, no fixed version is made, but old one is edited

fixed?
line was too long?
